\usage{
rt_match(variable_meta, rt_column, rt_window, id_column, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable_meta}{(data.frame) A data.frame of variable IDs and their corresponding rt values.}

\item{rt_column}{(character) Column name of the rt values in variable_meta.}

\item{rt_window}{(numeric, integer) Rt window to use for matching. If a single value is provided then the same rt is used for both variable meta and the annotations. A named vector can also be provided e.g. c("variable_meta"=5,"annotations"=2) to use different windows for each data table.}

\item{id_column}{(character) Column name of the variable ids in variable_meta. id_column="rownames" will use the rownames as ids.}

\item{...}{Additional slots and values passed to \code{struct_class}.}
}
\value{
A  \code{rt_match} object with the following \code{output} slots:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{updated} \tab          (annotation_table) The input annotation source with the newly generated column. \cr
}
}
\description{
Annotations will be matched to the measured variable meta data.frame by determining which annotations rt window overlaps with the rt window from the measured rt.
}
