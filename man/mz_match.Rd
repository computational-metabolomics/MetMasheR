\usage{
mz_match(variable_meta, mz_column, ppm_window, id_column, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable_meta}{(data.frame) A data.frame of variable IDs and their corresponding mz values.}

\item{mz_column}{(character) Column name of the mz values in variable_meta.}

\item{ppm_window}{(numeric, integer) Ppm window to use for matching. If a single value is provided then the same ppm is used for both variable meta and the annotations. A named vector can also be provided e.g. c("variable_meta"=5,"annotations"=2) to use different windows for each data table.}

\item{id_column}{(character) Column name of the variable ids in variable_meta. id_column="rownames" will use the rownames as ids.}

\item{...}{Additional slots and values passed to \code{struct_class}.}
}
\value{
A  \code{mz_match} object with the following \code{output} slots:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{updated} \tab          (annotation_table) The input annotation source with the newly generated column. \cr
}
}
\description{
Annotations will be matched to the measured data variable meta data.frame by determining which annotations ppm window overlaps with the ppm window from the measured mz.
